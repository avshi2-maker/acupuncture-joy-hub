Question,Answer,TCM Acupuncture Points,Pharmacopeia/Herbal Formula
What organ system is primarily affected by trauma in TCM?,"In Traditional Chinese Medicine, trauma primarily affects the Heart and Pericardium. The Heart houses the Shen (Spirit/Mind), which becomes unsettled or scattered after traumatic events. The Pericardium acts as the Heart's protector, and both can be overwhelmed by shock and terror, leading to Shen disturbance, anxiety, and disconnection from self.","HT-7 (Shenmen), PC-6 (Neiguan), PC-7 (Daling), GV-20 (Baihui)","An Shen Ding Zhi Wan (Calm the Spirit and Stabilize the Mind Pill) - calms Shen, anchors spirit, treats anxiety, palpitations, and fright"
How does trauma manifest emotionally and physically according to TCM?,"Trauma in TCM manifests as Shen disturbance with symptoms including anxiety, hypervigilance, insomnia, nightmares, palpitations, and startle responses. Physically, it presents as muscle tension, headaches, digestive upset, and autonomic dysregulation. The Heart and Kidney connection (water-fire axis) becomes disrupted, leading to fear-anxiety cycles and difficulty grounding.","HT-7 (Shenmen), KI-3 (Taixi), PC-6 (Neiguan), GV-20 (Baihui), Yintang (EX-HN3)","Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan (Emperor of Heaven's Special Pill to Tonify the Heart) - nourishes Heart Yin, calms Shen, treats insomnia, anxiety, and restlessness from Yin deficiency"
What is the relationship between Heart and Kidney in trauma processing?,"The Heart-Kidney axis is central to trauma processing. The Heart (Fire) and Kidney (Water) must communicate and balance each other. Trauma disrupts this connection: Heart fire flares up (anxiety, racing thoughts) while Kidney water fails to anchor it (fear, groundlessness). This creates Heart-Kidney disharmony with symptoms of anxiety above and fear below, restless spirit, and loss of felt safety.","HT-7 (Shenmen), KI-3 (Taixi), KI-6 (Zhaohai), PC-8 (Laogong), KI-1 (Yongquan)","Jiao Tai Wan (Grand Communication Pill) - connects Heart and Kidney, descends Heart fire, raises Kidney water, treats insomnia and anxiety from Heart-Kidney disharmony"
How does trauma affect the Liver and Gallbladder in TCM?,"Trauma significantly impacts the Liver and Gallbladder. The Liver stores blood and regulates emotions; trauma causes severe Liver Qi stagnation and blood stasis. The Gallbladder governs decision-making and courage; trauma weakens it, causing timidity, indecision, and startling easily. Liver-Gallbladder disharmony manifests as irritability, rage outbursts, nightmares, and bitter taste.","LR-3 (Taichong), GB-40 (Qiuxu), GB-34 (Yanglingquan), LR-14 (Qimen), GB-13 (Benshen)","Wen Dan Tang (Warm the Gallbladder Decoction) - transforms phlegm, calms Shen, strengthens Gallbladder, treats anxiety, insomnia, and nightmares from phlegm-heat disturbing Heart"
What is the role of Jing (Essence) depletion in chronic trauma?,"Chronic trauma depletes Kidney Jing (Essence), the foundational substance of life. Jing depletion manifests as premature aging, chronic fatigue, weak constitution, developmental issues, and susceptibility to further stress. When Jing is depleted, the body cannot recover from stress properly, creating a vulnerability cycle. This explains intergenerational trauma patterns in TCM understanding.","KI-3 (Taixi), CV-4 (Guanyuan), GV-4 (Mingmen), BL-23 (Shenshu), KI-7 (Fuliu)","Zuo Gui Wan (Restore the Left Kidney Pill) or You Gui Wan (Restore the Right Kidney Pill) - nourishes Kidney Yin/Yang, replenishes Jing, rebuilds constitutional foundation"
How does phlegm obstruction develop from trauma in TCM?,"Trauma-induced Qi stagnation impairs Spleen function and fluid metabolism, leading to phlegm accumulation. Phlegm can mist the Heart orifices, causing mental confusion, dissociation, and cognitive dysfunction. This creates 'phlegm-fire harassing the Heart' pattern with symptoms of mania, severe anxiety, incoherent speech, and impaired reality testing seen in severe PTSD.","ST-40 (Fenglong), PC-5 (Jianshi), HT-7 (Shenmen), GV-26 (Shuigou), CV-12 (Zhongwan)","Wen Dan Tang (Warm the Gallbladder Decoction) or Di Tan Tang (Scour Phlegm Decoction) - transforms phlegm, opens orifices, calms Shen, treats dissociation and confusion"
What is the significance of the Yin Wei Mai in trauma treatment?,"The Yin Wei Mai (Yin Linking Vessel) connects all Yin meridians and is essential for emotional regulation and integration. Its master point PC-6 (Neiguan) is crucial for trauma treatment, opening the chest, calming the Heart, and regulating the relationship between Heart and Pericardium. It helps process overwhelming emotions and restore emotional coherence after fragmentation.","PC-6 (Neiguan), SP-4 (Gongsun), CV-17 (Shanzhong), HT-7 (Shenmen), KI-9 (Zhubin)","Gui Pi Tang (Restore the Spleen Decoction) - nourishes Heart blood, strengthens Spleen, calms Shen, treats palpitations, anxiety, and insomnia from Heart-Spleen deficiency"
How does acupuncture help process trauma according to research?,"Research shows acupuncture modulates the autonomic nervous system, shifting from sympathetic (fight-flight) dominance to parasympathetic (rest-digest) activation. It regulates the HPA axis, reduces cortisol levels, and modulates amygdala activity. Acupuncture increases endorphins and serotonin while decreasing norepinephrine, helping to reprocess traumatic memories without re-traumatization.","GV-20 (Baihui), PC-6 (Neiguan), HT-7 (Shenmen), ST-36 (Zusanli), LR-3 (Taichong)","Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer) - soothes Liver, nourishes blood, strengthens Spleen, regulates stress response, treats irritability and emotional lability"
What acupuncture points help with dissociation and grounding?,"For dissociation and grounding, focus on points that connect to Earth and anchor the Shen. KI-1 (Yongquan - Bubbling Spring) at the foot sole strongly grounds scattered Qi. GV-20 (Baihui) at the vertex anchors the spirit. ST-36 (Zusanli) strengthens Earth element. SP-1 (Yinbai) treats excessive thinking. CV-6 (Qihai) gathers Qi in the lower Dan Tian for stability.","KI-1 (Yongquan), GV-20 (Baihui), ST-36 (Zusanli), CV-6 (Qihai), SP-1 (Yinbai), Yintang (EX-HN3)","Si Ni San (Frigid Extremities Powder) - regulates Qi, warms extremities, treats cold hands and feet from Liver Qi stagnation affecting circulation; helps reconnect body awareness"
What is GV-20 (Baihui) and why is it essential for trauma?,"GV-20 (Baihui - Hundred Meetings) at the crown of the head is where all Yang meridians meet. It calms the mind, lifts the spirit, treats all mental-emotional disorders. For trauma, it anchors the Shen that has scattered upward, treats dizziness, headaches, and mental confusion. Combined with KI-1, it creates a powerful axis connecting heaven and earth, restoring felt safety.","GV-20 (Baihui), GV-24 (Shenting), GV-16 (Fengfu), Sishencong (EX-HN1), Yintang (EX-HN3)","Ding Zhi Wan (Settle the Emotions Pill) - calms Shen, settles fright, nourishes Heart Qi, treats anxiety, restlessness, and scattered spirit from shock"
How does trauma affect the blood and cause blood stasis?,"Intense emotional trauma causes Qi stagnation which leads to blood stasis. Blood stasis manifests as fixed, stabbing pain, dark complexion, purple lips and tongue, and persistent traumatic memories that feel 'stuck.' In TCM, traumatic memories are stored in the blood (Xue), and blood stasis explains why trauma symptoms recur. Moving blood helps release stored trauma.","SP-10 (Xuehai), LR-3 (Taichong), LI-4 (Hegu), BL-17 (Geshu), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao)","Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang (Blood Mansion Stasis-Expelling Decoction) - invigorates blood, dispels stasis, regulates Qi, treats PTSD symptoms from blood stasis in the chest"
What is the role of the Hun (Ethereal Soul) in trauma processing?,"The Hun (Ethereal Soul) resides in the Liver and is responsible for sleep, dreams, planning, and visionary capacity. Trauma disturbs the Hun, causing nightmares, sleep disturbances, lack of direction, and inability to plan for the future. When the Hun is unsettled, it wanders at night causing vivid dreams and insomnia. Anchoring the Hun is essential for trauma recovery.","LR-3 (Taichong), GB-13 (Benshen), BL-47 (Hunmen), HT-7 (Shenmen), Anmian (EX-HN22)","Suan Zao Ren Tang (Sour Jujube Decoction) - nourishes Liver blood, anchors Hun, calms Shen, treats insomnia, vivid dreams, and restless sleep from blood deficiency"
How does trauma affect the San Jiao (Triple Burner)?,"The San Jiao regulates the movement of Qi and fluids throughout the body. Trauma disrupts San Jiao function, causing Qi stagnation in all three jiaos: upper (chest oppression, shallow breathing), middle (digestive issues, bloating), and lower (urinary changes, pelvic tension). San Jiao dysregulation explains the widespread physical symptoms of trauma affecting multiple body systems.","SJ-5 (Waiguan), SJ-6 (Zhigou), CV-17 (Shanzhong), CV-12 (Zhongwan), CV-6 (Qihai)","Si Ni San (Frigid Extremities Powder) or Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) - harmonizes Shaoyang, regulates Qi in all three jiaos, treats mixed patterns of constraint"
What is the significance of treating the spine and Du Mai in trauma?,"The Du Mai (Governing Vessel) runs along the spine and governs all Yang Qi. It connects to the brain and houses the Sea of Marrow. Trauma often lodges in the spine, creating tension, pain, and restricted movement. Treating Du Mai points (GV-4, GV-14, GV-20) restores Yang Qi flow, strengthens the will, and helps 'straighten' the person who has been bent by trauma.","GV-4 (Mingmen), GV-14 (Dazhui), GV-20 (Baihui), BL-11 (Dashu), GV-16 (Fengfu)","Kaixinsan (Open Heart Powder) - opens Heart, strengthens will, treats Heart-Kidney disharmony, fear, and lack of motivation; helps rebuild resilience and sense of purpose"
How should early trauma intervention differ from chronic PTSD treatment?,"Early intervention (0-3 months) focuses on stabilizing the Shen, preventing Qi stagnation, and supporting natural recovery. Use gentle tonifying methods: HT-7, PC-6, ST-36 with calming herbs. Chronic PTSD (>6 months) requires addressing established patterns: blood stasis, phlegm obstruction, Yin/Yang deficiency. Use stronger moving and breaking techniques with formulas that transform stagnation.","Acute: HT-7, PC-6, ST-36, Yintang. Chronic: Add LR-3, SP-10, ST-40, KI-3 based on pattern","Acute: An Shen Ding Zhi Wan, Gan Mai Da Zao Tang. Chronic: Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang (blood stasis), Wen Dan Tang (phlegm), Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan (Yin deficiency)"
What auricular (ear) points are used for trauma treatment?,"Auricular acupuncture is highly effective for trauma. The NADA (National Acupuncture Detoxification Association) protocol uses: Shenmen (calms spirit), Sympathetic (regulates autonomic nervous system), Kidney (reduces fear, strengthens will), Liver (moves stagnation, calms anger), and Lung (releases grief, strengthens Qi). These points collectively stabilize the Shen and regulate stress responses.","Ear Shenmen, Sympathetic Point, Kidney Point, Liver Point, Lung Point, Heart Point, Zero Point (Vagus regulation)","Auricular seeds or needles can be combined with oral herbs: Xiao Yao San for Liver Qi stagnation, Gui Pi Tang for Heart-Spleen deficiency, or An Shen formulas for acute anxiety"
How does trauma affect Wei Qi and immune function?,"Trauma depletes and dysregulates Wei Qi (defensive Qi), leading to immune dysfunction. The stress response diverts resources from immune function, weakening resistance to pathogens. Chronic trauma creates autoimmune tendencies as the body attacks itself. Wei Qi disturbance also manifests as hypervigilance (Wei Qi won't settle at night) and boundary issues (inability to filter external stimuli).","LU-7 (Lieque), ST-36 (Zusanli), LI-4 (Hegu), BL-13 (Feishu), CV-6 (Qihai)","Yu Ping Feng San (Jade Windscreen Powder) - consolidates Wei Qi, strengthens exterior, treats immune weakness; combined with Shen-calming herbs for trauma-related immune dysfunction"
What is the treatment principle for complex developmental trauma?,"Complex trauma requires long-term treatment addressing constitutional deficiencies. Focus on rebuilding Kidney Jing and Essence, nourishing Heart blood, strengthening Spleen Qi, and soothing Liver. Use gentle methods consistently over time. Avoid aggressive moving techniques that may re-traumatize. Build the root (Ben) while addressing branches (Biao). Treatment may take years to rebuild foundational resilience.","KI-3 (Taixi), CV-4 (Guanyuan), ST-36 (Zusanli), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), HT-7 (Shenmen), GV-20 (Baihui)","Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Kidney Yin) or Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan (Kidney Yang) as base; add Gui Pi Tang for Heart-Spleen; modify based on presenting patterns over time"
How does somatic experiencing relate to TCM trauma treatment?,"Somatic experiencing aligns with TCM's understanding of trauma stored in the body. TCM recognizes that emotions affect physical organs and that unprocessed trauma creates Qi/blood stagnation in tissues. Points like GB-21 (Jianjing), BL-40 (Weizhong), and SP-21 (Dabao) release held tension. Combining acupuncture with body awareness helps complete interrupted defensive responses (fight-flight-freeze).","GB-21 (Jianjing), BL-40 (Weizhong), SP-21 (Dabao), GB-30 (Huantiao), BL-60 (Kunlun), LI-15 (Jianyu)","Ge Xia Zhu Yu Tang (Drive Out Stasis Below the Diaphragm) - moves blood stasis in abdomen where trauma often lodges; combined with muscle-relaxing herbs like Ge Gen (Kudzu root)"
What role does breathwork play alongside acupuncture for trauma?,"Breathing directly affects Lung Qi and the autonomic nervous system. Deep, slow breathing activates parasympathetic response and descends Qi. Trauma survivors often have shallow, rapid breathing (Lung Qi reversal). Acupuncture points like LU-1, CV-17, and CV-6 combined with breathwork restore proper Lung function, regulate the Qi mechanism, and help process and release stored trauma.","LU-1 (Zhongfu), CV-17 (Shanzhong), CV-6 (Qihai), PC-6 (Neiguan), KI-1 (Yongquan)","Banxia Houpo Tang - regulates Qi mechanism, descends rebellious Qi, opens chest; particularly useful for trauma survivors with breathing difficulties and globus sensation"
How do the Window of Heaven points help trauma processing?,"Window of Heaven points (ST-9, LI-18, SJ-16, BL-10, GB-20, etc.) are located on the neck and connect head/body, regulating the flow of Qi and blood to the brain. They help with dissociation, clearing the mind, and integrating fragmented experiences. These points open sensory channels and help trauma survivors reconnect with their bodies and present-moment awareness.","LI-18 (Futu), ST-9 (Renying), SJ-16 (Tianyou), GB-20 (Fengchi), BL-10 (Tianzhu), CV-22 (Tiantu)","Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin (Gastrodia and Uncaria Beverage) - calms Liver Yang, extinguishes wind, clears the head; treats headaches, dizziness, and mental agitation from Liver Yang rising"
What is the role of the Chong Mai in processing trauma?,"The Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel) is the Sea of Blood and regulates blood flow throughout the body. Trauma stored in the blood affects Chong Mai function, causing menstrual irregularities in women, chest fullness, abdominal masses, and emotional rushing sensations. Treating Chong Mai (SP-4 + PC-6) helps regulate blood, calm emotional surges, and release blood-level trauma.","SP-4 (Gongsun), PC-6 (Neiguan), CV-4 (Guanyuan), ST-30 (Qichong), KI-21 (Youmen)","Shao Fu Zhu Yu Tang (Drive Out Stasis from the Lower Abdomen) - moves blood stasis from lower jiao, regulates menstruation, treats pelvic trauma and reproductive issues from emotional shock"
