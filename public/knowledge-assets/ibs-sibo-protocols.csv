1,IBS-D (Diarrhea),Spleen Qi Deficiency,"Patient: 'I have loose stools every time I eat. Why can't I hold food?'","Strategy: The Spleen is too weak to Transform & Transport. We must 'Tonify Earth' to dry the dampness. Do not purge.","ST36, SP3, CV12, BL20",Shen Ling Bai Zhu San
2,IBS-D (Morning),Kidney Yang Deficiency,"Patient: 'I wake up at 5 AM with urgent diarrhea (Cock's Crow). Why?'","Strategy: This is 'Gate of Vitality' failure. The Yang fire is too weak to cook the food overnight. We must use Moxa to warm the core.","CV4, GV4, BL23, ST25",Si Shen Wan
3,IBS-D (Stress),Liver Overacting on Spleen,"Patient: 'My stomach hurts and runs loose only when I'm stressed.'","Strategy: Wood is attacking Earth. Treating the gut alone will fail; we must calm the Liver (Stress) first to stop the attack.","LV3, ST25, SP6, Yintang",Tong Xie Yao Fang
4,IBS-C (Constipation),Liver Qi Stagnation,"Patient: 'I feel bloated and stuck, like pebble stools. Laxatives barely help.'","Strategy: The gut isn't blocked by solids, but by 'Air/Qi' tension. We must Move Qi, not just purge stool. Relax the intestine.","LV3, GB34, SJ6, ST25",Liu Mo Tang
5,IBS-C (Dryness),Blood/Yin Deficiency,"Patient: 'My stool is dry and hard to pass. I feel tired and dizzy.'","Strategy: 'No water in the boat.' The intestine lacks fluid. Bulk laxatives make this worse. We must Moisten and Nourish blood.","ST25, BL25, KD6, SP6",Run Chang Wan
6,IBS-C (Cold),Yang Deficiency Cold,"Patient: 'I have no urge to go, and my stomach feels cold to the touch.'","Strategy: The bowel lacks the 'heat' to move (peristalsis). We must warm the Yang to create movement force.","CV6, ST25 (Moxa), KD3",Ji Chuan Jian
7,IBS-Mixed,Disharmony of Cold/Heat,"Patient: 'I switch between diarrhea and constipation constantly.'","Strategy: This is a complex Shao Yang/Jue Yin pattern. We need a formula that can separate clear/turbid and handle heat/cold simultaneously.","ST25, ST37, SP9, LV3",Wu Mei Wan
8,SIBO (Hydrogen),Spleen Damp-Heat,"Patient: 'I bloat like a balloon immediately after sugar/carbs.'","Strategy: Rapid fermentation indicates Damp-Heat. We must aggressively drain dampness and clear the 'fermenting' heat.","SP9, ST40, CV12, REN9",Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi Tang
9,SIBO (Methane),Yang Ming Stagnation,"Patient: 'I am severely constipated and burp constantly.'","Strategy: Methane slows transit. We need strong 'descending' action (Yang Ming Fu). Prokinetics are essential here.","ST25, ST37, CV6, SP15",Da Cheng Qi Tang (Modified)
10,SIBO (Die-off),Toxic Heat Release,"Patient: 'I feel flu-like and toxic since starting the herbs.'","Strategy: This is a Herxheimer reaction. The bacteria are releasing endotoxins. We must clear Toxicity and Vent heat.","LI11, DU14, PC6",Yin Qiao San
11,Leaky Gut,Spleen/Kidney Deficiency,"Patient: 'I react to almost every food now. My system feels broken.'","Strategy: The 'holding' function of the Spleen is gone, allowing leakage. We must lift Qi and stabilize the barrier.","ST36, CV4, BL20, BL23",Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang
12,Gut-Brain Axis,Heart-Spleen Deficiency,"Patient: 'I get palpitations and anxiety that go straight to my stomach.'","Strategy: The Shen (Mind) and Yi (Digestion) are disconnected. We must nourish Heart Blood to calm the digestive nervous system.","HT7, SP3, CV12, Yintang",Gui Pi Tang
13,Gut-Brain Axis,Plum Pit Qi,"Patient: 'I feel a lump in my throat and chest tightness, but doctors see nothing.'","Strategy: This is 'Qi Stagnation' manifesting in the throat (esophagus). It is emotional stagnation. Resolve Phlegm-Qi.","CV22, PC6, LV3",Ban Xia Hou Po Tang
14,Food Stagnation,Retention of Food,"Patient: 'I feel like a brick is in my stomach, and my breath smells bad.'","Strategy: The mechanism is jammed. We must mechanically 'dissolve' the accumulation with digestive herbs (Hawthorn/Radish seed).","ST36, CV12, Linqi, ST44",Bao He Wan
15,Chronic Mucous,Damp-Heat in LI,"Patient: 'There is mucous/pus in my stool and it burns.'","Strategy: This indicates active inflammation/infection (Damp-Heat). We must clear heat and stop dysentery.","LI11, ST37, SP9, BL25",Bai Tou Weng Tang
16,Visceral Hypersensitivity,Liver Wind in Gut,"Patient: 'My gut cramps move around; it feels like spasms.'","Strategy: The nerves are hypersensitive (Wind). We must extinguish internal wind to stop the cramping spasms.","LV3, SP15, ST25",Tong Xie Yao Fang
17,Post-Infectious IBS,Latent Heat,"Patient: 'My gut hasn't been right since that food poisoning last year.'","Strategy: A 'Latent Pathogen' is hiding in the deeper levels. We must vent the lingering heat out to the surface.","ST44, LI11, SP9",Ge Gen Qin Lian Tang
18,Abdominal Distension,Qi Stagnation,"Patient: 'I feel full even after eating a tiny amount.'","Strategy: The Qi mechanism of the Middle Jiao is stuck. We simply need to re-start the flow of traffic.","PC6, ST36, CV12",Mu Xiang Shun Qi Wan
19,Borborygmus,Spleen Qi Def + Damp,"Patient: 'My stomach grumbles and makes loud noises constantly.'","Strategy: Water and Gas are mixing due to weak transport. Strengthen Spleen to quiet the 'sloshing' sound.","SP9, ST36, CV12",Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang
20,Rectal Prolapse,Spleen Qi Sinking,"Patient: 'I feel a heavy dragging sensation downward after bowel movements.'","Strategy: Spleen Qi is too weak to hold organs in place. We must use strong moxa and lifting herbs.","GV20, ST36, BL20",Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang
21,Fecal Incontinence,Kidney/Spleen Yang Def,"Patient: 'I cannot control my bowels sometimes.'","Strategy: The 'Gate' is not closing. We must astringe and warm the lower orifices strongly.","GV4, BL23, CV4, KD3",Si Shen Wan
22,Candida Overgrowth,Damp-Heat/Spleen Def,"Patient: 'I have brain fog, craving sugar, and a white coated tongue.'","Strategy: Fungus thrives in Dampness. We must 'Drain the Swamp' (Dampness) so the fungus has nowhere to live.","SP9, ST40, LI11",Shen Ling Bai Zhu San
23,Gastroparesis,Stomach Qi Deficiency,"Patient: 'Food sits in my stomach for hours without moving.'","Strategy: The Stomach Qi lacks the power to descend. We must tonify Stomach Qi and direct it downward.","ST36, CV12, PC6",Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi Tang
24,Excessive Gas (Flatulence),Liver/Spleen Disharmony,"Patient: 'I pass gas constantly, sometimes painful.'","Strategy: Gas is 'Wind' generated by fermentation (Damp) or Stagnation. Regulate the Liver and Drain Damp.","LV3, SP9, ST25",Xiao Yao San
25,Nervous Diarrhea,Liver/Spleen Disharmony,"Patient: 'I get the runs immediately before a meeting or event.'","Strategy: The 'Fight or Flight' (Wood) is purging the gut (Earth). We must stabilize the Spirit to hold the gut.","HT7, LV3, ST25",Tong Xie Yao Fang
