Question,Answer,TCM Acupuncture Points,Pharmacopeia/Herbal Formula
What organ system is primarily affected by anger in TCM?,"In Traditional Chinese Medicine, anger primarily affects the Liver organ system. The Liver governs the free flow of Qi throughout the body and stores blood. Anger causes Liver Qi stagnation and Liver Yang rising, leading to headaches, red eyes, irritability, and chest tightness. The Liver houses the Hun (Ethereal Soul) and governs planning and vision.","LR-3 (Taichong), LR-2 (Xingjian), LR-14 (Qimen), GB-34 (Yanglingquan)","Long Dan Xie Gan Tang (Gentiana Drain the Liver Decoction) - drains Liver fire, clears damp-heat, treats irritability, headaches, and red eyes from excess Liver fire"
How does anger manifest emotionally and physically according to TCM?,"Anger in TCM manifests as Liver Qi stagnation and rising Yang with symptoms including headaches (especially temporal/vertex), red face and eyes, neck tension, hypertension, dizziness, and bitter taste. Emotionally, it presents as irritability, frustration, rage outbursts, impatience, and resentment. Suppressed anger creates more stagnation; explosive anger indicates Yang rising.","LR-3 (Taichong), LR-2 (Xingjian), GB-20 (Fengchi), GB-43 (Xiaxi), Taiyang (EX-HN5)","Chai Hu Shu Gan San (Bupleurum Powder to Spread the Liver) - soothes Liver, regulates Qi, relieves constraint, treats Liver Qi stagnation with irritability and chest oppression"
What is the relationship between the Liver and Gallbladder in anger processing?,"The Liver and Gallbladder are paired Zang-Fu organs in the Wood element. The Liver stores blood and regulates Qi flow; the Gallbladder stores bile and governs decision-making. Anger affects both: Liver Qi stagnation causes irritability and resentment; Gallbladder dysfunction causes difficulty making decisions and acting on anger appropriately. Together they govern the healthy expression of assertiveness.","LR-3 (Taichong), GB-34 (Yanglingquan), GB-40 (Qiuxu), LR-14 (Qimen), GB-24 (Riyue)","Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) - harmonizes Liver and Gallbladder, resolves Shaoyang patterns, treats irritability with alternating chills and fever"
How does suppressed anger lead to Liver Qi stagnation?,"When anger is not expressed or processed, it causes Liver Qi to stagnate. This stagnation manifests as chest and rib-side distension, sighing, depression, irregular menstruation, breast tenderness, and a feeling of a lump in the throat (plum-pit Qi). Long-term suppression can transform into Liver fire or blood stasis, creating more severe pathology.","LR-3 (Taichong), LR-14 (Qimen), PC-6 (Neiguan), CV-17 (Shanzhong), GB-34 (Yanglingquan)","Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer) - soothes Liver, strengthens Spleen, nourishes blood, the primary formula for Liver Qi stagnation with depression and emotional constraint"
What happens when Liver Qi stagnation transforms into Liver Fire?,"Prolonged Liver Qi stagnation generates heat that transforms into Liver Fire. This manifests as intense irritability, explosive anger, throbbing headaches, red face and eyes, bitter taste, dry mouth, constipation, dark urine, and insomnia with vivid dreams. Liver Fire can injure Liver Yin, creating a cycle of fire and deficiency. Treatment must clear fire while protecting Yin.","LR-2 (Xingjian), GB-43 (Xiaxi), LR-3 (Taichong), GB-20 (Fengchi), Taiyang (EX-HN5), LI-11 (Quchi)","Long Dan Xie Gan Tang (Gentiana Drain the Liver Decoction) - powerfully drains Liver fire, clears damp-heat from lower jiao, treats extreme irritability and Liver fire patterns"
How does anger affect the Spleen and digestion?,"When Liver Qi stagnates, it often 'attacks' the Spleen (Wood overcontrols Earth). This creates Liver-Spleen disharmony with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea (IBS pattern), poor appetite, and fatigue. Emotionally, anger mixes with worry. Eating while angry severely damages digestion. Treatment must soothe Liver while strengthening Spleen.","LR-3 (Taichong), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), ST-36 (Zusanli), CV-12 (Zhongwan), LR-13 (Zhangmen)","Tong Xie Yao Fang (Pain and Diarrhea Formula) - harmonizes Liver and Spleen, treats IBS-type symptoms from Liver attacking Spleen; or Xiao Yao San for milder cases"
How does anger cause headaches in TCM?,"Liver Yang rising from anger causes characteristic headaches: temporal (Gallbladder channel), vertex (Liver channel), or behind the eyes. The pain is often throbbing, severe, and accompanied by irritability, red eyes, and sensitivity to light. Migraine patterns often involve Liver Yang rising with underlying Liver blood or Yin deficiency. Wind from Liver Yang creates sudden, intense pain.","GB-20 (Fengchi), Taiyang (EX-HN5), GB-8 (Shuaigu), LR-3 (Taichong), LR-2 (Xingjian), GV-20 (Baihui)","Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin (Gastrodia and Uncaria Beverage) - calms Liver Yang, extinguishes wind, treats headaches, dizziness, and hypertension from Liver Yang rising"
What is the relationship between anger and blood pressure?,"Liver Yang rising directly causes hypertension in TCM. Chronic anger keeps Liver Yang elevated, manifesting as high blood pressure, headaches, tinnitus, dizziness, and red face. The Liver's failure to smooth Qi flow causes blood vessel tension. Treatment calms Liver Yang, anchors rising Qi, and nourishes Liver Yin to prevent Yang from rising uncontrolled.","LR-3 (Taichong), GB-20 (Fengchi), ST-36 (Zusanli), KI-3 (Taixi), GV-20 (Baihui), LI-11 (Quchi)","Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin (Gastrodia and Uncaria Beverage) - primary formula for Liver Yang rising with hypertension; or Long Dan Xie Gan Tang for excess Liver fire patterns"
How does anger affect women's menstrual health?,"The Liver stores blood and regulates its release during menstruation. Anger-related Liver Qi stagnation causes PMS with breast tenderness, irritability, and mood swings. It leads to painful periods (dysmenorrhea), irregular cycles, and dark clotted blood. Liver fire can cause heavy bleeding, while Liver blood stasis causes fixed, stabbing menstrual pain. Treatment varies by pattern.","LR-3 (Taichong), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), SP-10 (Xuehai), CV-6 (Qihai), LR-14 (Qimen)","Xiao Yao San for Qi stagnation PMS; Jia Wei Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer Plus) adds herbs to clear heat for irritability with heat signs; Ge Xia Zhu Yu Tang for blood stasis"
What is LR-3 (Taichong) and why is it essential for anger?,"LR-3 (Taichong - Supreme Rushing) is the Yuan-source point of the Liver meridian, located on the dorsum of the foot. It is the most important point for soothing Liver Qi and treating all anger-related conditions. It moves stagnant Qi, calms Liver Yang, nourishes Liver blood, and regulates menstruation. Combined with LI-4 (Hegu), it creates the 'Four Gates' protocol for moving stuck Qi and emotions.","LR-3 (Taichong), LI-4 (Hegu) - Four Gates combination; add GB-34 for Liver-Gallbladder, LR-2 for fire, LR-14 for chest oppression","Chai Hu Shu Gan San or Xiao Yao San - both use Chai Hu (Bupleurum) as chief herb to move Liver Qi, mimicking the action of LR-3 in herbal form"
What is the Four Gates (Si Guan) protocol for releasing anger?,"The Four Gates uses bilateral LR-3 (Taichong) and LI-4 (Hegu) to powerfully move Qi throughout the body. LR-3 moves Liver Qi (blood level); LI-4 moves Lung Qi (Qi level). Together they open all twelve meridians, release constraint, calm the mind, and relieve pain. This is the primary protocol for anger, frustration, and stuck emotions affecting the whole body.","LR-3 (Taichong) bilateral, LI-4 (Hegu) bilateral - the Four Gates; often combined with CV-17 for chest, GB-34 for decision-making, Yintang for calming","Yue Ju Wan (Gardenia and Ligusticum Formula) - addresses six stagnancies (Qi, blood, phlegm, fire, food, dampness) that can develop from chronic Liver Qi stagnation"
How does anger affect the eyes in TCM?,"The Liver opens to the eyes, and anger directly affects vision. Liver fire causes red, burning, dry eyes. Liver Yang rising causes eye pain and light sensitivity. Liver blood deficiency causes blurry vision and floaters. Liver wind causes twitching eyelids and involuntary eye movements. Chronic anger ages the eyes faster and can contribute to eye diseases.","LR-3 (Taichong), GB-20 (Fengchi), GB-37 (Guangming), BL-1 (Jingming), LR-2 (Xingjian), GB-1 (Tongziliao)","Qi Ju Di Huang Wan (Lycium, Chrysanthemum, and Rehmannia Pill) - nourishes Liver and Kidney Yin, brightens eyes, treats eye problems from Liver Yin deficiency"
What is the role of the Hun (Ethereal Soul) in anger?,"The Hun (Ethereal Soul) resides in the Liver and governs sleep, dreams, life direction, and planning capacity. Anger disturbs the Hun, causing vivid angry dreams, difficulty envisioning the future, and impulsive decisions. When the Hun is not anchored by sufficient Liver blood, it wanders at night causing insomnia. Anger fragments the Hun's integrative capacity.","LR-3 (Taichong), GB-13 (Benshen), BL-47 (Hunmen), HT-7 (Shenmen), Anmian (EX-HN22)","Suan Zao Ren Tang (Sour Jujube Decoction) - nourishes Liver blood, anchors Hun, calms Shen, treats insomnia and vivid dreams from blood deficiency failing to anchor Hun"
How does chronic anger lead to blood stasis?,"Chronic Liver Qi stagnation eventually leads to blood stasis as Qi fails to move blood smoothly. Blood stasis from anger manifests as fixed, stabbing pain (especially in the hypochondrium and chest), dark complexion, spider veins, and purple lips and tongue. In women, it causes dark clotted menstrual blood and severe dysmenorrhea. Treatment must move both Qi and blood.","LR-3 (Taichong), SP-10 (Xuehai), LR-14 (Qimen), BL-17 (Geshu), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), LI-4 (Hegu)","Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang (Blood Mansion Stasis-Expelling Decoction) - invigorates blood, dispels stasis, moves Qi, treats chest pain and emotional constraint from blood stasis"
How does anger interact with other emotions creating complex patterns?,"Anger often mixes with or transforms into other emotions. Anger can mask fear (using aggression as defense). Suppressed anger becomes depression. Anger with grief attacks the Lungs. Anger affecting the Spleen creates worry and digestive issues. Chronic anger depletes Kidney Yin (Fire consuming Water). Treatment must address the primary and secondary emotional patterns.","Pattern-dependent: LR-3 + KI-3 for anger with fear; LR-3 + LU-7 for anger with grief; LR-3 + SP-6 for anger with worry; LR-3 + HT-7 for anger with anxiety","Xiao Yao San as base; add modifications: plus Zhi Zi for heat (Jia Wei Xiao Yao San); plus Kidney tonics for underlying fear; plus Lung herbs for grief"
What is the difference between Liver Qi stagnation and Liver Yang rising?,"Liver Qi stagnation is the initial pattern: constraint, distension, sighing, mood swings, frustration. It is excess in nature but doesn't have strong heat signs. Liver Yang rising is the progression: stagnation generates heat that rises upward, causing headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, red face, explosive anger. Yang rising indicates more severe pathology requiring stronger treatment.","Qi stagnation: LR-3, LR-14, PC-6, CV-17 (gentle moving). Yang rising: Add LR-2, GB-20, Taiyang, GV-20 (descending and cooling methods)","Qi stagnation: Chai Hu Shu Gan San, Xiao Yao San. Yang rising: Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin, Long Dan Xie Gan Tang. Yang rising from Yin deficiency: add Liu Wei Di Huang Wan"
How does acupuncture modulate the anger response neurologically?,"Acupuncture at LR-3 has been shown to reduce amygdala activation and decrease sympathetic nervous system arousal. It modulates the prefrontal cortex, improving impulse control. Points like GV-20 and HT-7 increase GABA and serotonin while decreasing cortisol and norepinephrine. Regular acupuncture helps retrain the nervous system toward balanced emotional responsiveness.","LR-3 (Taichong), GV-20 (Baihui), HT-7 (Shenmen), PC-6 (Neiguan), ST-36 (Zusanli)","Modern research validates traditional formulas: Xiao Yao San reduces cortisol and inflammatory markers; Chai Hu formulas modulate stress hormones and improve mood regulation"
What is the treatment principle for chronic suppressed anger?,"Chronic suppressed anger requires gradual movement of stagnation while building underlying deficiencies. Start with gentle moving of Liver Qi (LR-3, PC-6, CV-17) before using stronger methods. Address secondary patterns (Spleen deficiency, blood stasis, Yin deficiency). Emotional processing is essential - treatment opens the gates but the person must walk through. Weekly treatment for 2-3 months minimum.","LR-3 (Taichong), PC-6 (Neiguan), CV-17 (Shanzhong), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), ST-36 (Zusanli), LR-14 (Qimen)","Xiao Yao San long-term as base formula; modify based on pattern development: add blood movers for stasis, Yin tonics for deficiency, fire-clearing herbs for heat"
How does anger affect sleep according to TCM?,"Liver fire disturbs the Shen and Hun, causing difficulty falling asleep, vivid angry or violent dreams, and early waking (3-5am, Liver time). The unsettled Hun wanders excessively. Liver Yang rising causes restless sleep with grinding teeth. Liver blood deficiency from chronic anger causes dream-disturbed sleep and waking frequently. Treatment calms Liver while addressing the specific pattern.","LR-3 (Taichong), HT-7 (Shenmen), Anmian (EX-HN22), GB-13 (Benshen), LR-2 (Xingjian), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao)","Liver fire: Long Dan Xie Gan Tang or Huang Lian E Jiao Tang. Liver blood deficiency: Suan Zao Ren Tang. Mixed patterns: Jia Wei Xiao Yao San"
What dietary advice supports anger management in TCM?,"Avoid foods that increase Liver fire: alcohol, spicy foods, greasy foods, coffee, and excessive red meat. Favor foods that soothe Liver: leafy greens, celery, cucumber, mung beans, chrysanthemum tea, and mint. Sour flavor enters the Liver but can increase stagnation if excessive. Bitter greens clear Liver heat. Eat regularly to support Spleen and prevent Liver attacking Spleen.","Dietary therapy supports acupuncture; no specific points, but CV-12 and ST-36 support digestion when dietary changes are implemented","Herbal teas: Chrysanthemum (Ju Hua) clears Liver heat; Mint (Bo He) moves Liver Qi; Chai Hu (Bupleurum) as gentle liver-soothing tea"
How does physical exercise help process anger in TCM terms?,"Movement is essential for moving Liver Qi. Stagnation occurs when Qi doesn't flow. Exercise promotes Qi circulation, releases constraint, and provides healthy expression for pent-up energy. Vigorous exercise can clear excess Yang; gentle exercise (Tai Chi, Qigong) moves Qi without depleting. The Liver governs tendons - stretching specifically moves Liver Qi.","Exercise is self-treatment; acupuncture points that support exercise benefits: GB-34 (tendons), LR-3 (Liver Qi), ST-36 (Qi building)","Active exercise for excess patterns; Liver-soothing Qigong for deficiency patterns; stretching-focused practices benefit Liver regardless of pattern"
What is the relationship between anger and creativity in TCM?,"The Liver governs planning, vision, and the ability to see into the future. Healthy Liver Qi flow supports creativity and clear direction. Stagnant Liver Qi blocks creative expression - the person has ideas but can't execute them. Liver blood deficiency weakens the vision. When anger is properly processed and Liver Qi moves freely, creative energy is liberated and channeled productively.","LR-3 (Taichong), GB-13 (Benshen), GV-20 (Baihui), GB-40 (Qiuxu), PC-6 (Neiguan)","Xiao Yao San restores creative flow by moving Liver Qi; Chai Hu Shu Gan San for more pronounced stagnation blocking expression"
